💤 Sleep Apnea Detection System
📌 Project Overview

Sleep Apnea Detection System is a machine learning–based web application designed to identify sleep apnea conditions using sleep-related audio data. The system classifies the user’s condition into No Apnea, Mild Apnea, or Severe Apnea, helping in early detection and awareness of sleep disorders.

🎯 Problem Statement

Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops during sleep. Traditional diagnosis methods are expensive and require sleep laboratories, which makes early detection difficult for many people. This project aims to provide a low-cost and accessible solution using machine learning.
